§8 DEMONSTRATION SCORING — the LATENT rows (written + referent-thin).
Translation-studies instrument (DHd2027). Sibling of
deterministic-descriptive-fields/. BUILD + SMOKE + DRY here; the real
scoring run (--run) is fired by the orchestrator AFTER her review.

═══ THE LAW (reports/methodology_amendment_0721_53.md §2/§4; #53) ═══
deterministic-F = descriptive-F + latent-F. The descriptive row is the
sibling folder. THIS folder scores the LATENT rows:

  LATENT-WRITTEN — the field rides the visible written form (the char 赤
    inside 赤字; the etymon sidus inside "consider"). CLAIM = a conjunction
    of THREE severally-warranted checks, NO separate degree credential
    (her ruling 07-21, §2):
      (1) SCALAR-SAYS-FIELD  — the battery-credentialed descriptive axis,
          read at the line (the descriptive scorer's law). Needs the
          encoder → applied at --run only. In --dry/--smoke this leg is
          PENDING (reported, not evaluated) — the descriptive --dry has the
          same shape (fires without the scalar).
      (2) BOOLEAN-SILENT     — the descriptive word-level field boolean does
          NOT fire on the line (reused verbatim from the descriptive scorer:
          trait_labelers / illumination_labeler_53). Citation.
      (3) CARRIER-PRESENT    — a character in the line is field-charged per
          the CITABLE single-char inventories, AND the carrier's own word is
          field-silent in its own dictionary entry (the written sensor's
          (a)∧(b); §2 "the carrier is there and its dictionary entry carries
          the field"). Citation-by-inspection.
    A --dry/--smoke "written-row fire" = (2)∧(3) [boolean side]; (1) pending.

  LATENT-REFERENT (COLOUR only — the one credentialed meter) — the field
    rides world-knowledge of the referent. TRIGGER = a citable referent
    account (the committed definition-witness json, where covered); CCFD-
    covered words are TRUTH-side context only, NEVER triggers (§4, her
    07-21 evening ruling: a norm set credentials OR triggers, never both).
    DEGREE = the credentialed in-context meter
    (engine/word_latent_v5_referent_color_54.py: color_salience_
    axis_48.npz key "axis", LaBSE, attempt-6 F1 .800 precision 1.000 floor
    .70 THIN n=6, 2026-07-22) — its word-grain substitution protocol does
    NOT re-run here; per-line degree RIDES the line colour scalar (same
    axis/encoder law, read at line grain). Kept honest and thin.
    CITATION NOTE (accuracy pass #71): word_latent_v5_referent_color_54.py is
    NOT SHIPPED in this repo. The published record of that meter is its
    OUTPUT — engine/results/word_latent_v5_referent_color_54.json (plus the
    wide-pool rerun word_latent_v7_wide_referent_color_54.json, and the
    word_grain_referent_pass_* files that name it as "machinery … imported
    verbatim"). The citation stands as the credential's address; only the
    source file is absent.

═══ CARRIERS (the CITABLE single-char inventories) ═══
  colour       HowNet ∪ MOE-53  (latent_written_labeler_53 v2 — the written
               sensor of record; carriers + provenance + liveness emitted)
  illumination HowNet-only      (her ruling; latent_written_labeler_53 illum
               side, no MOE union)
  sound        HowNet ∪ her-sanctioned 声-amendment
               (engine/results/hownet_sound_chars_54_amended.json — A2)
  plant        any-position 259 (her 連理枝 ruling;
               engine/results/hownet_plant_chars_54.json)
  temporal     head-sememe 123  (engine/results/hownet_temporal_chars_54.json — A1)
  en           Skeat etymon chains (engine/etym_chains_v1_52.py) —
               FIELD_TERMS_EN covers colour + dark(→illumination) + star;
               sound/plant/temporal have NO en-etymon list → UNAVAILABLE.
  de / jp      NO citable char/etymon inventory → UNAVAILABLE (declared,
               never fabricated).

═══ SURVIVAL / COMPENSATION (the written→descriptive detector, §1) ═══
  Written meaning dies at a script boundary unless the translator
  COMPENSATES, so a written-latent survival score is a compensation-event
  detector. The written-row poem states feed rubric_compare's LATENT SLOTS
  for the 4 en↔zh pairs (poem grain, F1):
      src written-latent → tr DESCRIPTIVE active  = COMPENSATION-candidate
                                                    (latent→active = REVIVAL)
      src written-latent → tr written-latent       = survival (LATENT-CARRY)
      src written-latent → tr nothing              = loss (LATENT-UNREALIZED)
  Supplying both latent slots UNLOCKS the REVIVAL / PARTIAL-LOSS / LATENT-*
  cells the descriptive row folds away (its F4). In --dry the latent states
  are the boolean side (checks 2∧3), so previews are boolean-side only.

═══ FLAGGED OPEN DETAILS (minimal readings) ═══
  L-F1  FOLDER NAME. The descriptive README (its F4, §7) reserves the
        sibling name `deterministic-latent-written-fields/`; the build task
        names `deterministic-latent-written-fields/`. Built under the TASK name
        (this folder also carries the referent-thin row, so "-latent-" is
        the wider-correct name). Flagged for her rename if wanted.
  L-F2  CHECK-1 DEFERRAL. --dry/--smoke have no encoder → the scalar gate
        (check 1) is PENDING; written-row fires reported are the boolean
        side (checks 2∧3). --run applies check 1 (the descriptive axis at
        the line) and only then is the three-check conjunction complete.
        Same discipline as the descriptive --dry.
  L-F3  REALIZED-GATE LAYERING. Check 2 (descriptive boolean silent, line
        grain) uses trait_labelers/illumination (the descriptive lexicons).
        The written sensor's own (b) uses the WORD's HowNet DEF. They are
        different lexicons; a word could be HowNet-realized yet trait-silent
        or vice versa. MINIMAL READING: require BOTH — line-level trait
        silence AND per-carrier-word HowNet-DEF silence (the conservative
        union; fewer false latent fires). Emitted per fire.
  L-F4  en ILLUMINATION check-2. illumination has NO en descriptive boolean
        (zh-only, descriptive F2). So en illumination-written cannot
        complete the conjunction; en 'dark' Skeat chains are reported
        INFORMATIONAL, not counted as completed en written-latent fires.
        en written-latent survival-eligible field = COLOUR.
  L-F5  CONSIDER/STAR EXHIBIT. Skeat FIELD_TERMS_EN has color/dark/STAR;
        'star' is the founding example (sidus inside consider) but is NOT
        one of the five scored fields → surfaced as a fixed EXHIBIT,
        informational, outside the survival table.
  L-F6  REFERENT TRIGGER EXTRACTION. The committed witness json is a
        diagnostic dump, not a word→fires table. Trigger words are extracted
        best-effort (recursive walk: a word-record with a truthy colour
        signal). Thin by mandate; where a word is uncovered by the witness
        there is NO referent trigger (declared, never fabricated). CCFD
        (lexical_resources/impression_norms/ccfd_2021) is TRUTH-side context
        only and is CITED, not enumerated (openpyxl absent in venv).

Reuses VERBATIM from ../deterministic-descriptive-fields/
score_descriptive_fields.py: corpus loading (BOARD + local tier),
verse_lines, F9 redaction, boolean_states (the descriptive booleans =
check 2), maskable_units, load_axes/project/embed_inventory/scalar_readings
(the scalar leg = check 1), poem_inventory, sha256, SEED, determinism
discipline. Redaction law F9 applies verbatim.
