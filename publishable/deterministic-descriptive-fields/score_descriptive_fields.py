§8 DEMONSTRATION SCORING — the DETERMINISTIC DESCRIPTIVE FIELDS row.
Translation-studies instrument (DHd2027). Convened by the field owner
07-22 ("since these rows are pretty stable themselves, I think we can
start scoring"). BUILD + SMOKE + DRY here; the real scoring run
(--run) is fired by the orchestrator AFTER her review.

═══ THE LAW (reports/methodology_statement_0716.md, KEEP) ═══
  • THE SCALAR IS THE PAPER — graded trait-intensity scoring (§1, §7).
  • INSTRUMENTS ONLY. NO LLM MARKS ANYTHING — rulers/labelers produce
    every field state, source-side and translation-side alike (§5, §8).
    Nothing in this file asks a generative model for a judgment.
  • The 8-cell transition comparator is FIXED + tested:
    marking/tools/rubric_compare.py (RULERS.md l.12; spec prose in
    design/r2_scalar_shift_spec_52.md "Anchor"). We call it; we do not
    reimplement it.
  • Encoder = LaBSE; PCA-whitening (generic sample) then unit-norm;
    axis = mean(pole+)-mean(pole-) unit norm; score = projection; word
    contribution = score(line) - score(line with word deleted)
    (RULERS.md "Shared mechanics"). Each axis npz carries its OWN
    mu + W + axis key — verified. Same form as smoke_score_sheets_50.py
    (the reference; her sanity-check 07-18 "look sane and can be used").

═══ SCOPE: five credentialed DESCRIPTIVE fields, boolean + scalar ═══
  field         boolean state (which words fire, receipts)         scalar reading (line-grain, R1 credential)

  illumination  illumination_labeler_53.label       (zh)           illum_polarity_axis_v3_48.npz["dark"]        .825 [.740-.906]  (RULERS A1, physical VALUE dark+)
  sound         trait_labelers.label_unit["sound"]  (en+zh)        sound_salience_axis_v3_49.npz["axis"]        .815 [.786-.843]  (RULERS A5, realized)
  plant         trait_labelers.label_unit["plant"]  (en+zh)        plant_salience_axis_48.npz["axis"]           .801 [.756-.841]  (RULERS A4)
  temporal      trait_labelers.label_unit["temporal"] (en+zh)      duration_value_axis_48.npz["axis"]      rho .860 [.843-.875]  (RULERS A7, VALUE long+)
  NOTE temporal scalar = the DURATION ruler (A7); temporal-SALIENCE
  (A9) is a documented negative and is NOT used (RULERS A9; task spec).

═══ FLAGGED OPEN DETAILS (minimal readings; see README §"Open details") ═══
  F1 GRAIN. rubric_compare.py is tested at POEM level; its own boundary:
     "Line-level comparison awaits an alignment file — never guessed."
     R2 (b) requires a CHAIR-DRAFTED s<i>->t<j> alignment file (unfrozen,
     absent on disk for sonnet 73). MINIMAL READING: default to the
     law-stated fallback (poem grain); line-pair mode runs only if an
     alignment file is supplied (--align), flagged unfrozen.
  F2 BOOLEAN LANGUAGE COVERAGE. The boolean shelf is EN + ZH only
     (illumination is ZH-only: its runtime lexicon is HowNet W_C =
     Chinese words). German has no boolean lexicon; Japanese-in-kanji
     hits the ZH lexicons only INCIDENTALLY via shared Han characters —
     which is NOT a validated JP labeler. MINIMAL READING: a field's
     boolean STATE is emitted only for covered languages; for de/jp
     targets the state is UNAVAILABLE (never fabricated, never "absent").
     Consequence: the transition table classifies only pairs where BOTH
     sides are boolean-covered.
  F3 SCALAR CROSS-SIDE. §3: raw cross-side scalar deltas are NEVER
     compared (measured 5.6x compression); comparison is
     ensemble-relative (rank). Per-field equating (R2 (c)) is UNFROZEN
     and awaits her convening. MINIMAL READING: emit per-side line
     scalar + per-side ensemble RANK; emit the raw delta flagged
     NON-TRANSFERABLE; apply no equating.
  F4 LATENT FOLD. This is the DESCRIPTIVE row only. No latent files are
     supplied, so rubric_compare.py runs FOLD-DECLARED (active/absent
     states; reachable cells SURVIVAL / DEFORMATION / INVENTION). The
     latent tier is the sibling folder deterministic-latent-written-fields/.
  F5 MASKING GRAIN (per-word Delta receipt only). R1 credentials are
     token-true. The primary scalar (the LINE projection) is
     masking-independent. The secondary per-word Delta receipt uses
     jieba word-units for zh, whitespace for latin, per-char for jp
     (no jp tokenizer in venv) — jp Delta is char-grain (smears 叠字/
     compounds), flagged; it does not affect the line reading.
  F6 pypinyin absent in venv → sound-device 雙聲/叠韵 pinyin-fallback is
     skipped (中古/叠字/rep/alliteration paths intact); color/plant/
     temporal are pypinyin-independent.
  F9 LOCAL_TIER (in-copyright acquisitions). By house law in-copyright
     transcriptions live OUTSIDE the repo (books/dnd2027/corpus/
     transcriptions/); the repo carries provenance + shas only. This
     scorer reads them as declared inputs (paths + shas recorded in the
     run manifest) but the OUTPUTS REDACT their line text: word-grain
     receipts (firing tokens) + numbers only, never full-line quotes of
     an in-copyright translation inside publishable/. Kraus is held to
     the same rule (his own header: "US PD not asserted").

Determinism discipline (house scorers): sorted iteration · encode
seed = RandomState(48) for the re-order certificate (batch_size=1,
drift < 1e-6, matching smoke_score_sheets_50.py) · every input
sha256-pinned into the output manifest.
