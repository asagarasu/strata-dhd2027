"""THE LAW, single-sourced (#60, 2026-07-27, her order: rewrite, not patch).

Every function here is the ruling implementation of one law-piece; exhibits,
harnesses, and the census (since v4.2) import from HERE and nowhere else.
Extracted verbatim from the post-amendment gen_sample_exhibits_59 (whose
exhibit half is deprecated). Semantics of record as of 07-28 —
per-word trigger SPLIT BY AXIS KIND (her re-census ruling, 07-28 late night,
#62 — supersedes the prior all-fields two-sided law): SALIENCE axes
{color, plant, sound} are POSITIVE-ONLY (dd >= cut — a negative Δ there is
dilution, not an event), VALUE rulers {illumination dark+, temporal long+}
stay TWO-SIDED (|dd| >= cut — "greatly negative means saliently short/bright",
her original 07-28 duration reasoning, still correct for signed value axes).
The full ruling + its superseded history live on triggered_tokens (house law:
corrections carried on their face). Census of record: findings_v50 (v4.9 and
before were the two-sided era). GHOST PINNED AT THE WORD (her ruling 07-28) —
the line-gate
makes no states; a line over the verse null with no token account is a
LINE-RESIDUAL annotation (line_residual(): zh sides, illumination excluded),
never a state, never a crossing; precedence stated > latent > ghost >
silent; device = parallel organ.
No project-module imports; no encoder; pure functions over committed JSON."""

    pass it), never read. The line-scalar's one epistemic lane is

    ── THE fr TOKEN-GHOST STAR — HISTORY, carried on its face (house law:
    corrections superseded, never erased).
    ORIGINAL RULING (her convening, 2026-07-28): a fr token-ghost is a PARTIAL
    investigation — the fr written/referent channels are uncovered, so a fr
    colour token-ghost (word-silent, boolean covered since 07-28, no channel
    claiming the triggered token) was STARRED SUGGESTIVE (the fourth return
    True on the token-ghost branch when rid.startswith("fr:")), declaring the
    blindness on the face. That star split ~247 crossing-rows (33 distinct
    fr:baudelaire colour source token-ghosts × their seats) into the suggestive
    tier.
    SUPERSEDED — SAME NIGHT — by her REVERSAL RULING (2026-07-28 late night,
    #62, verbatim): "I think we should reverse the star situation. We should
    somehow indicate that 'zh is terrific and we have the full support here!'
    while other ones we write in prose about 'ok this is not built and from
    what we see in zh it is really really thin.'" The DEFICIENCY star retires;
    the FULL-SUPPORT side is marked POSITIVELY (the zh full-stack BADGE, driven
    by FULL_STACK_LANGS, in exhibit_gen_60); the non-zh referent thinness is
    carried in PROSE (the scope-sentence), NOT stars. Measured bound behind the
    reversal (chair count 07-28): the zh referent leg alters 2 of 669 word-tier-
    silent verdicts (colour 0/352, sound 2/317 — 0.30%); the blindness is real
    but thin. So the fr branch below returns FALSE-FOR-ALL — the fr token-ghost
    no longer stars. Census of record under the star: v5.0 (findings_v50); under
    the retired star: v5.1 (findings_v51). NOTE: the present*/silent* stars
