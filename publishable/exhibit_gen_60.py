"""Exhibit generator, rewritten from scratch (#60, 2026-07-28 — her orders:
删了重写 [deleted and rewritten], harness-gated, single-sourced; and, said by her 很多很多遍 [many, many times] and finally
implemented in full: THE DETERMINISTIC COLUMNS ARE THE INVESTIGATION OF THE
TOP-TOK).

Semantics of the row, of record:
  - top-tok — PER-AXIS since F8 (her ruling 07-29, #63; registration
    display_law_F8_toptok_registration_0729_63.md): SALIENCE axes = the max
    POSITIVE contentful token (the strongest admissible mover under the
    v5.0 positive-only trigger); if none exists, the least-negative
    contentful token draws FADED with its signed value (third grammar —
    nearness, never a fire's ink). VALUE axes = the |Δ|-max contentful
    token, sign kept (two-sided by law) — the meter's gaze.
  - the LINE HIGHLIGHT is the top-tok, always; its colour = which channel
    claims that very token (her 07-28 ruling).
  - the three deterministic cascade cells answer, FOR THE TOP-TOK ONLY:
    does the dictionary claim it? does the written channel claim it? does the
    referent channel claim it? Channel fires on OTHER words of the line are
    context, rendered as a pale "(line: …)" footnote inside the cell — they
    never impersonate the top-tok's investigation (attribution never migrates
    in ink — her walk).
  - device stays a PARALLEL LINE ORGAN by law (叠字/alliteration are line
    phenomena; never trigger-gated) — it is not part of the per-word probe.
  - line STATE remains the whole-line law (a stated word anywhere states the
    line); the state pair column carries it, with via in the sidecar.

Three stages, strictly separated: build_model (ALL semantics, single-sourced
from committed JSON via linegrain_law_60) → render (pure layout) → gate
(BEFORE anything lands). Sidecar .model.json = the provenance of every cell.

Gate = her caught bug classes as standing assertions:
  A. cascade cells equal the top-tok's freshly-recomputed claim status
  B. count-mismatched seats are STATUS rows with zero data cells
  C. top-tok is the true |Δ|-max contentful token
  D. displayed units clean; line-context receipts equal committed data
  E. the line highlight IS the top-tok whenever locatable
