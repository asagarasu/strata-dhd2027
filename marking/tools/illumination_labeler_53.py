"""Illumination boolean labeler — whole-field REPLACEMENT for
dark_labeler_52.py (field owner's ruling, 07-20, in session):
dark_labeler_52.py was built dark-side-only; every other boolean
labeler in this family is whole-field (citable dictionary-derived
word-list checker, one per field), so the field owner ruled this
field must be whole-field too: "is this word openly about
illumination — darkness or brightness alike." This file is that
labeler. dark_labeler_52.py is NOT edited by this change — it stays
in place as the record of the dark-only build and its selftest
history (the 波黑 substring bug, the 黑夜 boundary finding). Read it
first for that history; this docstring assumes it.

SAME-DAY DERIVATION-SET FIX (07-20, in session; house precedent:
dark_labeler_52.py's same-sitting jieba/substring fix, 波黑 fired via
黑, caught by selftest and fixed same sitting). The first cut of this
file matched only the pair bright|明 on the bright side, which left
光明 silent (its own HowNet DEF records are {honest|诚实},
{lights|光}, {promissing|前景佳} — none is bright|明). The field owner
ruled this too narrow, verbatim: "we cannot have a checker saying
光明 is not light. 明天 can be not light and that is sane." Fix: widen
the bright pole from the single pair bright|明 to the full set of
HowNet sememe pairs a fresh inventory scan over HowNet.txt verifies
as illumination-denoting (bright|明, lights|光, Brightness|明暗,
illuminate|照射 — see BRIGHT_PAIRS below and
illumination_labeler_53_selftest.md for the complete candidate table,
occurrence counts, and an include/exclude call with reason for every
pair touching 光/明/亮/耀/照/辉 or an English light-root found in the
scan). 光明 now fires via lights|光 (its own DEF contains {lights|光}
verbatim). 明天 is untouched by this fix either way: all its DEF
records are time|时间 with modifier={future|将来} — purely temporal,
no bright-class pair in any candidate considered, so it stays silent
as required. Same law as always, still: citable derivation, no
dev-fitted lexicon, no FN/FP-driven edits ever — wider gloss set, not
a looser rule.

THE RULE (the PI, 07-15/16) still applies verbatim, unchanged: citable
derivation, no dev-fitted lexicon, no FN/FP-driven edits ever. Same
law, wider gloss set.

Derivation (mechanical, one pass, lexicon emitted beside this file):
  zh illumination = every HowNet W_C such that ANY of its DEF records
  (one word may span several NO. blocks / senses in HowNet, each with
  its own DEF line) carries a dark-class sememe OR a bright-class
  sememe:

    DARK pole   — a bare-English sememe token in {black, dark, dim,
                  gloomy} appears anywhere in the DEF line. UNCHANGED
                  from dark_labeler_52.py's GLOSS rule and from the
                  first cut of this file, carried over verbatim: bare
                  matching is safe on this side because none of these
                  four English glosses collide with an unrelated
                  HowNet sememe. NOT touched by today's fix.

    BRIGHT pole — the FULL PAIR appears in the DEF line, matched as a
                  pair (the English sememe token together with its
                  own paired Chinese gloss), for ANY pair in
                  BRIGHT_PAIRS:
                    bright|明        — first cut; 167 words alone.
                    lights|光        — NEW today; this is what fixes
                                       光明 (its own DEF is
                                       {lights|光}).
                    Brightness|明暗  — NEW today; 明暗's own DEF is
                                       exactly {Brightness|明暗:
                                       host={physical|物质}}.
                    illuminate|照射  — NEW today; the general HowNet
                                       sememe for light fixtures/
                                       lamps, light emission/
                                       reflection/refraction,
                                       radiation-as-light, sun- and
                                       moonlight exposure (灯, 台灯,
                                       反光, 光照, 闪光, 蜡烛, ...) —
                                       verified over its full 264-word
                                       membership, see selftest md.
                  Full-pair matching is LOAD-BEARING on every one of
                  these, not just bright|明: HowNet reuses the same
                  Chinese gloss character across unrelated English
                  primitives. 光 glosses BOTH lights|光 (illumination)
                  AND polished|光 (smooth/glazed — 光滑, 光洁, 刨子/
                  刨床, a woodworking sense with nothing to do with
                  light). 明 glosses bright|明 but ALSO explain|说明,
                  prove|证明, naif|不精明, Obviousness|明显性 (all
                  abstract/mental, not visual). 照 glosses
                  illuminate|照射 but ALSO TakeCare|照料 (caregiving).
                  耀 glosses ShowOff|炫耀 (boastfulness) with no
                  bare-耀 sememe of its own. Bare-English or
                  bare-Chinese-character matching on any of these
                  would silently pull in unrelated words (光滑, 光荣,
                  说明, 照料, 炫耀, ...) — wrong per the field owner's
                  ruling. Matching full pairs avoids this; see the
                  selftest md's inventory-scan table and the 光荣/光滑
                  polysemy trip-check probes (direct DEF inspection
                  confirms 光荣's only DEF is glorious|荣 and 光滑's
                  only DEF is polished|光 — neither is an adopted
                  pair, so neither fires).

                  Color-value and fire/heat pairs are excluded on the
                  same principle as the first cut's light|淡
                  exclusion, extended to what this scan turned up:
                  light|淡 (color-value/pale, e.g. red|红:degree=
                  {light|淡}); lighting|点燃 (combustion/ignition —
                  点燃 is "kindle/ignite"; its 94-word membership is
                  overwhelmingly matches/explosives/arson, e.g. 打火机,
                  火柴, 炸药, TNT — the English gloss "lighting" reads
                  like a light word but the HowNet primitive is
                  fire-family, not illumination); fire|火, hot|热,
                  Heat|热量 (heat is not illumination, per the task's
                  own exclusion rule).

  Source: lexical_resources/sewrl/datasets/HowNet.txt — same file,
  same substrate as dark_labeler_52.py. sha256 of that file is
  recorded in the emitted lexicon json for provenance.

Interface UNCHANGED from dark_labeler_52.py: label(unit_text) -> bool
+ carriers; jieba token matching; 叠字 rule (an XX token fires if X is
in the lexicon). The token-matching loop in label() below is copied
from dark_labeler_52.py near-verbatim (attribution: dark_labeler_52.py,
#52 night) — only the lexicon underneath it is wider (union of the two
poles instead of the dark list alone). derive()/build_lexicon() are
new: two poles instead of one, plus hownet_sha256 provenance.

KNOWN BOUNDARIES (found by selftest, declared, NOT "fixed" — same law
as dark_labeler_52.py's 黑夜 finding):
  - 黑夜 stays silent, unchanged: it tokenizes whole and its own
    HowNet DEF is temporal (night-as-time), not dark-class. Carried
    over as-is; this is the labeler's established empirical behavior.
  - 皎皎 is IN the derived bright lexicon (its own DEF is bright|明,
    ×3 records) but the LABELER stays silent on bare input "皎皎":
    jieba tokenizes it as two singleton chars ['皎','皎'], not one
    2-char token, so the 叠字 rule (which only inspects a single
    length-2 token) never gets a chance to look at it, and bare 皎
    alone is not in the lexicon (its own DEF is clear|清). This is a
    tokenizer-boundary gap between "word is in the list" and "labeler
    fires," not a derivation error — reported, not patched. UNCHANGED
    by today's fix.
  - 灿烂 stays silent: own DEF is the atomic sememe magnificent|灿烂
    (×13 records, all identical). Today's scan considered
    magnificent|灿烂 as a candidate and EXCLUDED it: the English gloss
    "magnificent" denotes grandeur/impressiveness, not literal shine
    — nothing in its dictionary sense requires light (contrast
    Resplendence|辉煌 below). Same call as the first cut, now made on
    purpose after inventory review rather than left untested.
  - 辉煌 stays silent: own DEF is 7 records of magnificent|灿烂 plus 1
    of the atomic sememe Resplendence|辉煌. Today's scan considered
    Resplendence|辉煌 too and excluded it: 辉煌 is HowNet-tagged
    predominantly (7/8 of its own DEF records) as the same
    splendor-class primitive as 灿烂, not as a light-quality primitive
    — the one Resplendence record doesn't outweigh that, and 灿烂's
    exclusion reasoning applies to its majority sense.
  - lights|光 (and, compositionally, illuminate|照射) also pull a
    small number of words that denote the ABSENCE of, or shelter
    FROM, light — not brightness — into bright_words: 阴, 树荫, 浓荫,
    绿荫, 阴凉, 树阴 each carry a DEF record shaped
    {place|地方:{exempt|免除:ResultEvent={illuminate|照射:agent=
    {lights|光:...}},location={~}}} — "a place EXEMPT FROM
    illuminate|照射," i.e. shade — and 遮阳板 (sun visor) carries
    {...{obstruct|阻止:instrument={~},patient={illuminate|照射}}} —
    "obstructs illuminate|照射." The pair-presence rule has no
    negation handling (the first cut never handled negation for
    bright|明 either — same mechanical limitation, just newly visible
    because lights|光/illuminate|照射 happen to appear inside
    HowNet's own exempt/obstruct relational structures). Reported,
    not patched — same law.
  - n_both (words carrying both poles): see the emitted lexicon json
    for the current count; report in illumination_labeler_53_selftest.md,
    not hand-verified here in the docstring since it can shift with
    the HowNet snapshot.
See illumination_labeler_53_selftest.md for the full probe table and
the inventory-scan candidate table (every pair considered, counts,
include/exclude call and reason).
