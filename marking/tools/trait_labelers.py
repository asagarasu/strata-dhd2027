"""Arm-1 boolean trait labelers: color, sound (2 tiers), plant, temporal.

═══ 2026-07-28 night (#61): DE COLOUR + EN-TEMPORAL — the fr blueprint · HeidelTime ═══
Two additions this build (branch de-temporal-support-61; colour-only for de,
temporal for en; en/zh/fr outputs BYTE-IDENTICAL — proven by regression):
  · DE COLOUR LEG — a language-gated `lang=='de'` colour leg in label_unit (the
    fr precedent 50cb569/2ebf673), consulting the German colour sets via a
    FORWARD PARADIGM MAP (grüner→grün, weissen→weiß). Sets = B&K12-German ∪
    kaikki.org German Wiktextract adj colour-sense; built by engine/
    de_build/ (extract_kaikki_de_color.py → build_de_color_inventory.py →
    de_labelers.py). On a German unit the en xkcd base is NOT consulted (the
    lang!='de' guard) so German non-colour words that collide with en colour
    names (fern='far', Rosen→rose) do not false-fire. Colour-only, citation-tier;
    de written/referent stay UNCOVERED (starred PARTIAL-INVESTIGATION, the fr law).
  · EN TEMPORAL — the AUTHORED-INTERIM ⚠ EN_TEMPORAL hardcode is RETIRED and
    replaced by a cited word-list-of-facts DERIVED from HeidelTime's published
    English resource files (Strötgen & Gertz 2013, LRE, README item [4]; GPLv3,
    no code/patterns copied), LOADED AS DATA from lexical_resources/temporal_
    lexicon/en_temporal_inventory_61.json (built by en_temporal_derive_61.py),
    UNIONed with EN_TEMPORAL_RULED_EXCLUSIVE {twilight,dusk} (ruling (c) below —
    an independent standing ruling with its own receipt). INTERACTION AUDIT:
    EN_TEMPORAL is subtracted from en_color(); the swap changes en_color() by
    exactly one member — 'midnight' now yields to temporal (a HeidelTime part-of-
    day term also in the xkcd base; a true cross-field exclusive, correctly
    yielded). BK11 is UNTOUCHED (ruling (a) safe). twilight/dusk preserved.
STATUS: BUILT + SELFTESTED (de-seat colour lines fire; temporal months/seasons/
units fire; en/zh/fr byte-identical). PROPOSED; adopt-by-numbers in the morning.

═══ 2026-07-27/28 night (#61): EN-COLOUR YIELD LAW — ruled by An, of record ═══
en_color()'s old blanket "names yield to the other field" (en_plant subtraction,
commit c65c3b4) over-yielded: it ate BK11 basics orange+pink AND 72 xkcd colour
names (rose/violet/olive/lavender/lilac/peach/plum/cherry/mint/sage/mustard/
fern…) — the second cause of the #61 rosy pseudo-ghost (commit 6bf9088). Her
four rulings, now ONE coherent law (see the block above en_color()):
  (a) BK11 basics NEVER yield (Berlin & Kay 1969); orange/pink restored.
  (b) xkcd∩en_plant names are NOT deleted — FLAG-class, fire colour + declared
      polysemy (byte-mirror of the fr nuit ruling, commit 50cb569: priced, not
      hidden — the live exemplar now that EN_COLOR_FLAG is empty, gold+fair both
      removed at the #61 no-vibes audit). See en_color_plant_flag().
  (c) EN_TEMPORAL subtraction KEPT (true cross-field exclusivity — twilight/dusk
      ARE the other field; arm-1 receipt v11 L134). Yielded, not flagged.
  (d) EN_COLOR_YIELD_RULED — per-word ruled yields; dark→illumination (her ruling
      after the correspondances en:dillon "darkness" finding), so a future
      darkness→dark fold cannot state colour. Named/citable/appendable.
STATUS: BUILT + SELFTESTED (`python3 trait_labelers.py` — pink/orange fire clean,
rose fires flagged, dark does not fire colour). The morphological fold that folds
rosy→rose (the pseudo-ghost's FIRST cause) is the #61 Stage-2 build (en_morph_
fold; the variant of a flag-class base inherits flag-class).

═══ 2026-07-26 (#58): word-tier SOUND built — PROPOSED ═══
The delivered "sound" boolean was DEVICE-tier only (叠字/雙聲/聯綿/allit/
word-rep — euphony ENACTED). A word-tier "does this word DIRECTLY DESCRIBE
sound" labeler (歌聲/噪/鳴/noise/song — sound MENTIONED) never existed; every
"descriptive ×5 fields" summary rounded that substitution into a tick
(reports/sound_descriptive_gap_0726_58.md). Correction, device≠descriptive:
  · the device block's output key RENAMES "sound" -> "sound_device"
    (receipts byte-identical);
  · a new field "sound" = the word-tier labeler (zh three citable legs
    釋樂∪音部∪廣韻 ∩ line chars, leg-tagged · en WordNet auditory closure
    ∩ folded words). See _zh_sound_legs()/en_sound_word() below.
STATUS: BUILT + SELFTESTED (founding line 上有弦歌聲, en line, device
regression — `python3 trait_labelers.py`). PROPOSED, pending field-owner
adoption and the descriptive-pass rerun cascade. Board scoring NOT run here;
the one-line scorer field-list change is in the build note, not applied.
Derivation receipts / rejected seeds / collisions / rerun cascade:
reports/sound_word_labeler_build_58.md.

═══ 2026-07-26 (#58): descriptive COLOUR ZH re-derived — Option A, ADOPTED ═══
The zh colour side was the last AUTHORED-INTERIM ⚠ lexicon (ZH_COLOR, flagged
since the 07-15 provenance ruling); the en side (B&K ∪ XKCD) already stood.
Fixed as a citable derivation with two zh legs (proposal
reports/colour_descriptive_proposal_58.md, field-owner-adopted Option A):
  · CHAR tier  — ZH_COLOR re-derived from 禮記·玉藻 五色 (正色/間色, wikisource
                 PD) ∪ 蓝(藍) as the one occurring clean gap-fill. ⚠ RETIRED.
                 廣韻 色-gloss sweep documented as GAP-CHECK ONLY (not wired).
  · COMPOUND tier — ZH_COMPOUNDS gains the 144 中国传统色 compound names
                 (zerosoul MIT, simp-only), colour-typed, maximal-match. Compound
                 grain is collision-safe → net-new 琥珀/金色 fire, 青翠/雪白
                 precision, and the latent/stated distinction is PRESERVED (a
                 tight char set keeps 碧/皎/縞… latent). EN unchanged (poop stays,
                 field-owner-validated).
STATUS: BUILT + SELFTESTED (compound-colour fires, qingqing chars unchanged,
masking-interaction probes, sound/device regression — `python3 trait_labelers.py`).
The full colour-cascade rerun is registered in
publishable/rerun_registration_0727_colour_58.md.

═══ THE RULE (the PI, provenance ruling 07-15; restated verbatim 07-16:
"NO any dev-fitted lexicon") ═══
Every lexicon in this file is either a CITABLE DERIVATION from a
named source, or is flagged AUTHORED-INTERIM with a named citable
replacement. A lexicon whose CONTENTS were selected by dev
performance is dev-fitted regardless of when editing stopped — the
old "freeze" framing (no further dev edits) is the weaker corollary,
not the rule. Consequence: no FN/FP-driven lexicon edits, ever;
citable-derivation improvements are legal at any time (with
recalibration reported, drops included — the honest drop IS the
finding).

═══ CURRENT STATE (2026-07-16 audit, #48) ═══
Output type: BOOLEANS per field per unit. Scalars do not exist here;
the intensity program is a separate build (design/
trait_intensity_program_48.md). Calibration (dev, zh/en in-scope,
POST-v3.1-provenance state — reproduced from this code 07-16; the
delta §10 / calibration-report tables are PRE-provenance and stale):
  color P.91 R.83 F1.87 · sound P1.00 R.50 F1.67 ·
  plant P.70 R.88 F1.78 · temporal P.94 R.73 F1.82
The provenance replacement moved these honestly (authored lists →
derivations; the drop IS the finding). Rerun `python3
trait_labelers.py` for the always-current table; trust the print
over any document, including this one.

# ═══ THE EN-COLOUR YIELD LAW (rulings #61, ruled by Anneliese, of record,
# 2026-07-27/28 night; build agent) — ONE coherent law so we don't confuse
# ourself down the road. What the base yields, and what it does NOT, when a
# name is claimed by another field. Provenance receipts, all four rulings:
#   · flag-not-delete doctrine: commit 50cb569 (nuit FLAGGED not gated —
#     "priced not hidden"); the fr precedent this en side now mirrors.
#   · the OLD "names yield to the other field" (plant subtraction): commit
#     c65c3b4 + reports/arm1_calibration_v11_20260715.md L134 ("en plant =
#     WordNet closure … + naive plural folding"). That blanket subtraction
#     ate BK11 basics orange+pink AND colour names rose/violet/olive/lavender/
#     lilac/peach/plum/cherry/mint/sage/mustard/fern (72 xkcd∩en_plant names) —
#     the #61 rosy pseudo-ghost's second cause (commit 6bf9088).
#   · cross-field EXCLUSIVITY that DOES hold (twilight/dusk yield to temporal):
#     arm-1 receipt L134 ("cross-domain exclusivity (twilight yields to
#     temporal)"). KEPT — a true different-quantity fact.
# (a) BK11 BASICS NEVER YIELD to anything (Berlin & Kay 1969: the 11 basic
#     colour terms are the field's own foundation; a basic term outranks any
#     other field's claim on the same string). orange/pink restored.
# (b) xkcd names colliding with en_plant() are NOT deleted — they become
#     FLAG-CLASS (fire + declared polysemy), exactly mirroring the fr nuit ruling
#     (50cb569 — the live exemplar; EN_COLOR_FLAG itself is empty after the #61
#     no-vibes audit removed gold+fair): the type-prior fires, wears the price tag,
#     zero occurrence intervention. See en_color_plant_flag().
# (c) EN_TEMPORAL subtraction KEPT (true cross-field exclusivity, not polysemy:
#     twilight/dusk ARE the other field; arm-1 receipt L134). Not flagged —
#     yielded, because the colour reading is not co-present, it is the wrong
#     field. This is the ONE blanket subtraction that survives.
# (d) EN_COLOR_YIELD_RULED — per-word ruled yields (named, citable, appendable).
#     "dark" (xkcd name) yields to ILLUMINATION — her ruling tonight after the
#     correspondances en:dillon L7 "darkness" finding: were an EN morphological
#     fold to fold darkness→dark, xkcd's "dark" would wrongly state the line
#     COLOUR; dark is the illumination field's, not colour's. Yielded (removed),

# (arm1_calibration_v11_20260715.md: the authored lexicons were declared
# "PROVENANCE-INVALID for the paper"). Neither carries a polysemy citation. BOTH
# are now GONE — the set is EMPTY:
#   · gold — REMOVED at the audit (4629cdf, receipts-only, census byte-identical BY
#     CONSTRUCTION): gold is a BK/xkcd basic colour (xkcd 'gold #dbb40c'), so with
#     the flag gone it fires CLEAN colour via en_color() (state stays 'stated'; the
#     census reads fires==True unchanged — PROVEN at that build's end).
#   · fair — REMOVED now (v4.9, this sitting). She RULED at the #61 fork where the
#     audit HELD it: "remove fair. (though it is a color for makeup foundation,
#     lol)". fair is NOT a colour word in ANY lexicon (not xkcd, not BK11); it only
#     ever fired colour BECAUSE of this hand-declared flag — so post-removal it
#     fires NOTHING (no set, no flag channel). This is NOT receipts-only: it flips
#     the colour fire-state on the 5 census lines where 'fair' is the SOLE colour
#     trigger (qingqing xu_yuanchong L3 · qingqing waley_1918 L9 · correspondances
#     scott_1909 L10 · invitation millay L5 · elevation dillon L16: stated→silent,
#     or →ghost if another token line-scalars colour-hot). Those 5 flips + one
#     receipt-only drop (qingqing en:birrell L5, where 'rouge' — a clean xkcd
#     colour — co-fires, so the cell STAYS stated and only the 'fair' receipt
#     leaves) are the entire ruled colour-only delta; the census re-baselines

# no-vibes-flag law, 950d10b: flags require citable support) and drops in here —
# the channel exists, it is simply empty of uncited memory. (A citable colour
# inventory — e.g. a documented fashion/commerce swatch source — could one day
# repopulate this and the base honestly; until such a source lands, the set is
# empty and flags return ONLY with citations.)

#       (contents picked from dev FPs 07-15, pre-rule; replacement path =
#       HowNet multi-char DEF lookup). KEPT for continuity (#58).
#
#   (2) the COLOUR compound tier (#58, 2026-07-26) — DERIVED, citable:
#       中国传统色 (traditional Chinese colour names), 144 compound names from
#       lexical_resources/color_lexicon/chinese_colors_zerosoul_20260720.json
#       (github.com/zerosoul/chinese-colors, MIT © 2019 Tristan Yang; upstream
#       a Sina 中国传统颜色 blog post, opaque beyond that — DISCLOSE in
#       publication; PROVENANCE.md / ACQUISITION_STATUS.md). 144 = the 161 leaf
#       names − 16 single-char names (char tier / ZH_COLOR) − 1 four-char data
#       anomaly 绀青绀紫 (dropped). Compound grain is COLLISION-SAFE (月白≠月,
#       水色≠水, 竹青≠竹): the maximal-match masks the whole span before the
#       char-harvest, so a colour name built on a plant/temporal char (松柏绿/
#       柳绿/竹青/秋色/玄色…) fires COLOUR and does NOT leak that char to plant/
#       temporal — the hound-tension vanishes at compound grain. Only 4 of the
#       144 occur in the corpus (琥珀 金色 青翠 雪白; none carries a cross-field
#       char — verified, so the shared masking machinery leaves plant/temporal/
#       sound byte-identical). Simplified forms ONLY: no in-house opencc-style
#       simp→trad resource exists (checked), so the traditional twins are NOT
#       hand-authored (provenance rule) — a documented simp-only LIMITATION.
#       The 4 corpus-occurring names are script-invariant (simp==trad), so this
#       limitation costs no verdict on this corpus. Rationale/sizing:
